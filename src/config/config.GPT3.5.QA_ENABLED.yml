  project_context: "KeePass Password Safe is a small system that can be easily transferred from computer to computer by a simple USB stick. Its purpose is to solve a problem that really bothers many people today when they have to choose from memorizing a lot of passwords to be secure or to use every time the same one so they won’t forget it but risk be found out by others. So it provides you a very secure, encrypted database where you can keep inside all your passwords, usernames, email accounts, URLs, notes without any risk for others to find them. That is because KeePass Password Safe can lock every database with only one Master Password
and/or key file. There are no duplicates, anywhere in your computer, of this Master Password and/or key file so in case of lost database cannot be opened by anyone. Not even by you and that is because there is no
recovery password or back door."
